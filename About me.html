                <p>HI! I'm Mohamed and I'm a drug addicted alcoholic. Here are a few facts about me:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>I'm 25 years old and I'm a Leo.</li>
                    <li>I grew up in Lagos, Nigeria but my parents are originally from Guinea.</li>
                    <li>I have two sisters and an older brother. I'm very close with my sisters but not my brother.</li>
                    <li>I moved to the US when I was 14 years old. I attend Lincoln High School and I graduated in 2018.</li>
                    <li>I have a partner of 6+ years and we've never been happier. My partner went to school for cybersecurity. We are planning on moving to the westcoast after I graduate with my degree.</li>
                    <li>My parents and I don't see eye-to-eye when it comes to some of my lifestyle choices but they love and care for me regardless.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="child">
                <p>I've struggled with addiction since the age of 14 which was when I came out to my parents and they didn't take the news way that I thought they would. I have attempted suicide four-times in my lifetime and I've been working on my mental health ever since. I didn't know to go about dealing with the negativity in my life so I turn to drugs and alcohol.<br>
                <p>I was down bad around the time my partner and I started dating. He helped me get clean and sober. He loved and nurtured me when I couldn't love myself. He saw the light in me when I only saw darkness. If not for him, I honestly don't know where I would be today. I have stumbled on my path to recovery but everyday that I don't drink or use is a good day for me.<br>Fast forward to today, I took it upon myself to take back control of my life instead of living on cruise-control.</p>
